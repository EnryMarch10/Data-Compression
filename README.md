## Summary

This project explores the following topics:  

1. **Randomness**  
   - Introduction to randomness in data and its implications in computational processes.  

2. **Entropy**  
   - Understanding entropy as a measure of information content and its role in data compression.

3. **Data Compression**  
   - Overview of data compression techniques and algorithms.  
   - Analysis of specific algorithms tailored for certain file types.  
   - General discussion of compression strategies and their efficiency.  

4. **Compression Tools**  
   - Examination of major compression tools available on Windows and Linux.  
   - Historical development and comparison of their underlying algorithms (e.g., Huffman coding, LZ77).  
   - Insights into implementations, with a focus on open-source solutions where applicable.

The goal is to provide a clear and concise understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of data compression,
while offering a comparative view of tools and technologies developed over time.
